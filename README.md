> Critique ability are crucial in the scalable oversight and self-improvement of Large Language Models (LLMs). While many recent studies explore the critique ability of LLMs to judge and refine flaws in generations, how to comprehensively and reliably measure the critique abilities of LLMs is under-explored. This paper introduces <b>CriticEval</b>, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively and reliably evaluate four key critique ability dimensions of LLMs: feedback, comparison, refinement and meta-feedback. <b>CriticEval</b> encompasses nine diverse tasks, each assessing the LLMs' ability to critique responses at varying levels of quality granularity. Our extensive evaluations of open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal intriguing relationships between the critique ability and tasks, response qualities, and model scales.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare

#### 1.1 Prepare Dataset

Download the dataset from [huggingface dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/opencompass/CriticBench) by running this command:
```bash
mkdir data
cd data
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/opencompass/CriticEval
```
which get into the `data` folder and clone the CriticEval dataset.
Note that the human-annotated Likert scores, preference labels, and critiques in `test` set are excluded.
You can submit your inference results on the `test` set (via run codes under `inference` folder) to this [email](lantiangmftby@gmail.com). We will run your predictions and update the results in our leaderboard. Please also provide the scale of your tested model. 
The structure of your submission should be similar to that in `example_data`.

#### 1.2 Prepare Code and Env

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-compass/CriticEval.git
# prepare the env for evaluation toolkit
cd critic_bench
pip install -r requirements.txt
# prepare the env for LLM inference
cd ../inference
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Inference LLMs on CriticEval

You need to inference LLMs to be evaluated on our proposed CriticEval, and generation results on CriticEval can be found in `inference/outputs` folder. 
If you are interested with our prompts for LLM, they are shown in [inference/utils/prompts.py](inference/utils/prompts.py).
Specifically, the inference code should be like:
```python
# this line loads all the evaluation dataset in CriticEval from `inference/utils`
datasets = load_all_datasets(args['data_dir'])

# these lines init the tokenizer and models from huggingface
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    args['model_name'],
    trust_remote_code=True
)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    args['model_name'], 
    device_map="auto", 
    trust_remote_code=True
).cuda().eval()

...

# inference the LLM and save the results in json file format
for abbr, dataset in tqdm(datasets.items()):
    path = os.path.join(folder_path, abbr + ".json")
    results = {}
    for item in tqdm(dataset['dev']):        
        
        # If you want to inference other LLMs, please revise this line
        response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, item['question'], history=[])
            
        results[str(len(results))] = {
            'origin_prompt': item['question'],
            'prediction': response
        }
    # save the results into json file, with the abbr as the file name
    with open(path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(results, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
```

We only provide the inference codebase for our [InternLM2-7B-Chat](https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm2-chat-7b), but it is easy to revise the inference code for evaluating your own LLMs (more details are in [inference/internlm2.py](./inference/internlm2.py)).

#### Example Inference Data of Representative LLMs

We have already released the generation results of some representative LLMs on CriticEval, and you could found them in [example_data/prediction_v1.3.tgz](example_data/prediction_v1.3.tgz).

```bash
tar -xzvf example_data/prediction_v1.3.tgz
```

After unzipping, you could found the details of the predictions of LLMs on CriticEval. Typically, the format of the evaluation files are: `{split}_{domain}_{dimension}_{format}.json`, where `split`, `dimension`, and `format` are described above. The `domain` represents 9 task scenarios in our proposed CriticEval, consisting of `translate`, `chat`, `qa`, `harmlessness`, `summary`, `math_cot`, `math_pot`, `code_exec`, `code_not_exec`. Refer to more details in our paper.
Here are some notes: 
* the `comp_feedback` critique dimension always company with an `reverse` file which is used to address the well-known positional bias problem for LLM-as-a-judge procedure. Refer to more details in Section 4 of our paper.
* For `feedback` critique dimension, each `domain` has additional `*_correction_part.json` files, saving the evaluation results of critiques for the correct or the very high-quality responses. Refer to more details about these response in our paper.

The format of the evaluation result file is:
```python
{
    '0': {
        'origin_prompt': 'The original prompt for LLMs to be evaluated',
        'prediction': 'The generated critiques to be evaluated'
    }
}
```

### 3. Compute the Evaluation Results on CriticEval

After getting the generation results under `inference/outputs`, your next step is to compute the objective and subjective scores in our proposed CriticEval using our toolkit.
See more details about the objective and subjective scores in Section 4 of our paper.

We provide two ways for computing the `objective` and `subjective` scores in `critic_bench` folder.
* Objective scores could be computed automatically without any cost
* Subjective scores rely on the advanced GPT-4-turbo model for automatic evaluation

#### Compute Scores

It is easy to compute the scores by running following commands.

Before running this code, please make sure that your own OpenAI API key in [critic_bench/run.sh](critic_bench/run.sh) is set.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

Then, running the following codes for evaluation:

```bash
./run.sh <dimension> <format> <split> <save_dir>
```

* `dimension` denotes critique dimensions defined in our proposed CriticEval, which are `feedback`, `correction`, `comp_feedback`, and `meta_feedback`. Refer to more details about these critique dimensions in Section 2 of our paper.
* `format` denotes the critique format `objective` and `subjective`. Objective scores are spearman correlation, pass rate, preference accuracy that can be computed automatically without any cost, while subjective scores are computed by prompting GPT-4-turbo to compare generated critiques and our human-annotated high-quality critiques in CriticEval.
* `split` denotes the `test` or `dev` set to be evaluated.
* `save_dir` is any text path saving the evaluation results.

In [run.sh](critic_bench/run.sh) file, you could find the corresponding commands for objective and subjective evaluation process. 
For example, for the feedback critique dimension, the objective evaluation is like:
```bash
python run_feedback.py --root_dir "../data/CriticEval" --prediction_dir "../example_data/prediction_v1.3" --split $3 --obj True
```
* `root_dir` contains the path of the `test` and `dev` set in CriticEval.
* `prediction_dir` contains the inference results of LLMs to be evaluated. We also provide the inference results of some representation LLMs  in `example_data`. If you want to evaluate your own LLMs, please refer to `inference/README.md` for more details, and the `prediction_dir` could be set as `../inference/outputs`.
* `split` denotes whether the `test` or the `dev` set is used.
* `obj` denotes that the objective evaluation is activated

For the subjective evaluation of the feedback critique dimension, the evaluation command is like:
```bash
python run_feedback.py --root_dir "../data/CriticEval" --prediction_dir "../example_data/prediction_v1.3" --evaluation_dir "../example_data/evaluation_v1.3/" --batch_size 1 --split $3 --obj False
```
* `evaluation_dir` saves the subjective evaluation scores of GPT-4, which can be re-loaded if the subjective evaluation process borke off. The order of the samples in each file in `evaluation_dir` follows the order in the original data in CriticEval (`data/CriticEval`).
* `batch_size` controls the number of the process for access GPT-4 API under multiprocessing setting.

The evaluation results of GPT-4 under `save_dir` is `jsonl`, and each line contains the evaluation results. The chain-of-thought evaluation results prompted by GPT-4 is in the `evaluation` key-value in each line, which is a `dict` consisting of the chain-of-thought rationale about GPT-4 (key-value `cot`) and a Likert score (key-value `score`) for each critiques, ranging from 1 to 10.
* 1 denotes the worst performance
* 10 denotes the best performance
* 8 denotes the comparable performance with our human-annotated high-quality critiques, and scores higher than 8 denotes the better performance of evaluated critiques.
